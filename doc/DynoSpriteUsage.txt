What is DynoSprite?
-------------------

Back in the 1980s, when the Coco and its contemporary home computers were all in vogue, our
favorite Radio Shack creation didn't get nearly the quality and quantity of game releases that
other computers did.  One of the reasons for this is that, unlike some of the other computer
platforms which had custom chips for processing graphics or sound, the Coco had no such hardware,
and all graphics and sound had to be performed at a low level in software.  Due to the relatively
low performance of the 8-bit CPUs of the era, it was extremely difficult to write software which
could get graphics and sound quality on par with what was available from custom chips in other
computers.  The software engineering effort necessary to make good games on the Coco was very
difficult, and as a result our users suffered from a relative lack of quality games.

To address this situation and to assist in making my own game, I wrote the DynoSprite engine.
This engine provides a framework for a game author to work with graphics and sound at a higher
level, greatly reducing the development effort while also providing hardware handling routines
with near-optimal performance.  I have taken many of the most difficult and tedious to write
software routines for a high-performance game on the Coco and packaged them into a framework
for all Coco game authors to use.  My hope is that DynoSprite will allow game developers to spend
their time working on the interesting parts of game development, like the art, physics, and
gameplay, rather than beating their heads by trying to get out the last drop of performance. I've
already done all the head banging for you.

What can DynoSprite Do?
-----------------------

Here is a list of the key features supported by DynoSprite:

 - 320x200 16-color graphics mode.
 - Full screen tilemapped background field, which can scroll horizontally in 2-pixel increments,
   or vertically in 1-pixel increments.
 - Background tiles are 16x16 each, with up to 255 different tiles per level, and the maximum
   tilemap size is 2000 tiles wide by 68 tiles high.
 - Sprite engine with draw routines that are dynamically compiled into 6809 assembly code, for
   maximum performance. Sprites can be positioned anywhere on the screen with single-pixel
   precision.
 - 2-voice audio output for sound effects or music, using either the Coco's internal 6-bit DAC
   our Orchestra-90 digital audio outputs.
 - Support for keyboard and joystick control.
 - Support for both RGB and Composite monitor types.
 - Variable frame rate system so game can maintain sense of speed when the frame-rate drops.
 - High-performance data compression for all game data.
 - Sophisticated build system for processing, packaging, and compressing all game data.
 - Includes logic for loading all game data from disk, decompressing, and managing memory.
 - All of the game code is separated from the core engine code, and there is an object-oriented
   design to the interface between the game and the engine.
 - Tested and validated on many different Coco variants, including on a real Coco 3 with RSDOS and
   a floppy drive, a CocoNET MicroSD cartridge, a Coco SDC adapter, HDB-DOS with DriveWire over the
   serial port, and with the Vcc and MESS emulators.

How can I use DynoSprite?
-------------------------

The first thing that you should do is to learn how the engine works and what its capabilities are,
to determine whether or not DynoSprite can provide the features that you need for your game.  Read
this document completely to get a general overview of DynoSprite.  If you have questions, you can
dig in to the source code to find the answer (there are lots of comments in the code), or ask the
author (Richard Goedeken) directly on the MaltedMedia.com Coco mailing list or the #coco_chat IRC
channel on irc.freenode.net.

Next, browse through a little bit of the source code to familiarize yourself with the technical
details.  I would recommend looking through at least the following 3 source files:

 1. engine/globals.asm    - Wost variables defined here are in the direct page, though there are
                            some larger buffers at the end of the file which are not in the DP.
 2. engine/datastruct.asm - The Data File layouts and Game Data Directories layouts aren't that
                            important to learn right away, but you should look through the
                            structure definitions for the various tables (SGT, SDT, ODT, COT).
 3. engine/main.asm       - Read through the main loop for a high-level understanding of the game
                            program flow.

Finally, read through the demo source code to see how the game code and data files interact with
the DynoSprite engine.  All of the game-specific files reside in the "game/" sub-directory:

game/readme-bas.txt           - Template text file that is used to generate the README.BAS file
                                which is included with the output Coco disk.  Lines which begin
                                with "{X}" are centered, with the charater X filling in the left
                                and right sides.

game/images/images.txt        - For each Splash image, this descriptive text file gives 24-bit RGB
                                values for 3 different special colors: the foreground, background,
                                and the 'progress bar' color.  This is used for the fade-in and
                                fade-out routines.  Splash images are currently only used for the
                                main menu and level loading screens, though a game could use them
                                for other purposes as well (cut scenes).

game/levels/01-marbledemo.txt - The DynoSprite Demo only has one 'level', and this file gives the
                                parameters used to describe this level to the engine, including:
                                - Level Name & Description (used in level loading screen)
                                - List of Sprite/Object groups to load for this level
                                - Maximum size of Current Object Table for level
                                - Index number of Tileset to use for background tilemap
                                - Size of background tilemap (in X and Y dimensions)
                                - Starting coordinate of screen window, relative to background
                                - Initialization structures for objects to create at level start
                                The object's (ball's) starting coordinates are generated by the
                                level initialization code for the demo, so the values (globalX
                                and globalY) are 0 here.

game/levels/01-marbledemo.asm - Contains assembly source code for the 2 level functions:
                                Level_Initialize and Level_CalculateBkgrndNewXY.  Note that these
                                functions are the only game code which is not required to be
                                position-independent.  The Level_Initialize function is called once
                                at Level load time: it increases the size of the background tilemap
                                to 256x64, clears it, and randomly places tetris-like blocks of
                                colored tiles.  The Level_CalculateBkgrndNewXY function is called
                                once for each output video frame: it examines the state of the
                                joystick axis positions and calculates a new starting X,Y
                                coordinate for the screen.  This causes the background tilemap to
                                be scrolled for the next frame.  This function also decides when to
                                load a new level.  In the demo, Level 1 is reloaded when the
                                joystick button is pressed.

game/levels/01-marbledemo.map - Contains a matrix of hexadecimal tileset indices which map out the
                                background tilemap used for this level.  The dimensions of this
                                matrix must match those given in the level description file
                                01-marbledemo.txt.  For the DynoSprite demo, this data is actually
                                not used.  At level initialization time, the Level_Initialize
                                function increases the size of the background tilemap to 256x64,
                                clears it, and randomly places tetris-like blocks of colored tiles.

game/objects/01-numerals.asm  - Sprite/Object group 1 contains 16 Sprites of size 10x18 which draw
                                hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F). There are 2 Objects defined: a
                                6-digit BCD counter, and a Hex Memory Value Readout.  Neither of
                                these are used by the demo as it was released, but they were used
                                during debugging and are very useful objects.  This assembly file
                                contais the 4 Object functions (Init, Reactivate, Update, Draw) for
                                these two objects.

game/objects/02-balls.asm     - Sprite/Object group 2 contains 10 sprites of size 17x17 which draw
                                the balls.  Two are static (Whole and Outline), and the other two
                                are animated with 4 frames each.  There is 1 Object defined, and
                                this assembly source file contains the code for the 4 Object
                                functions for this Ball object.  This code is responsible for
                                velocity reduction (friction), collision detection and ricochet
                                handling for bouncing or dragging on the side of the window, and
                                collision detection and ricochet handling for collisions between
                                balls.

game/sounds/01-pool_ball_hit.wav  - Uncompressed audio file for sound effect. This file can be any
                                    bit depth or sampling rate, because it will be converted during
                                    build.

game/sprites/*.spr                - Contains 5 parameters and a pixel matrix for each sprite in the
                                    Sprite/Object group.  The palette used for the level is taken
                                    from the Tileset, so the pixel values used in the sprite matrix
                                    must match with the colors defined in the Tileset's palette.

game/tiles/00-rainbowpyramids.txt - This text file defines the tileset used by the demo level.  It
                                    consists of the palettes to use for Composite and RGB monitors
                                    (in decimal numbers) and then one 16x16 hexadecimal matrix for
                                    each background tile, with the tile matrices separated by one
                                    blank line.

Now you should know everything that you need to make a game with DynoSprite!  Fire up your dev
tools and start pixeling, mapping, animating, and coding to make your game!

Engine Files (6x09 assembly language)
-------------------------------------

config.asm                  - Contains assemble-time configuration constants used by the engine.
                              Currently the only such constant is SOUND_METHOD, which determines
                              how the audio code handles the Coco's 6-bit audio DAC.

constants.asm               - Contains assemble-time constant values.  Currently only the keycodes
                              used with the Input_IsKeyPressed function are here.

datastruct.asm              - Documentation and structure definition macros for DynoSprite tables.
                              Also contains documentation for the structures of the data files on
                              disk, and the Game Data Directories stored in the DYNO.BIN program.
                              The Game Data Directories are used to assist in the identification
                              and loading of the game data from the disk files.

disk.asm                    - Functions for Disk I/O using the DKSCON interface.  Compatible with
                              RS-DOS, HDB-DOS, SDC-DOS, CocoNET, and probably others. One function
                              initializes global data structures for the file directory on the
                              disk, and then a simple file API is provided: Open, Seek Forward,
                              Read, and Close functions are given.  Only one file at a time can be
                              open.

globals.asm                 - Definitions for all of the global data variables and buffers. The
                              first part contains data which reside in the Direct Page ($2000).
                              All data which is defined here is visible and usable from all parts
                              of the engine and game code at all times.

graphics-bkgrnd.asm         - Contains all of the higher-level functions for managing the
                              scrolling background tilemap. This file also contains a high-level
                              description of the operation of the scrolling background feature.

graphics-blockdraw-6309.asm - Contains a 6309-optimized version of Gfx_DrawBlockRows function,
                              which draws a variable number of rows (between 1 and 16) of a
                              background tile, onto both the Even-start and Odd-start screen
                              buffers in one buffer pair.

graphics-blockdraw-6809.asm - Contains 6809-compatible code for Gfx_DrawBlockRows function.

graphics-image.asm          - Contains a function for loading Splash images, and fading in and
                              out.  The Fade routines go to/from a Splash image or menu, and a
                              blank screen filled with a single (background color) pixel value.
                              These routines are used for the menus and level loading screens.

graphics-sprite.asm         - Functions for allocating and freeing the Sprite subsystem variables,
                              and the default Sprite draw routine (used to draw each Object which
                              has a drawType value of 1).  Also contains an unimplemented function
                              for drawing with a RowCrop table (not yet supported), which would be
                              used for Objects with a drawType value of 2.

graphics-text.asm           - Contains a function for drawing text on the screen, and a buffer
                              with font bitmap data.  This function is only used for debugging
                              (SWI) and menus, because it is slow and writes destructively to
                              the screen.  Unlike the hex digits in the Sprite/Object group 1,
                              these text characters cannot be erased once drawn.

input.asm                   - Functions for reading Joystick and Keyboard state.

loader.asm                  - Contains all of the logic used to load and unload Level data.  From
                              the game-specific code (in either the Level or Object update
                              functions), you can call the Ldr_Jump_To_New_Level function defined
                              here to jump to a new level.

macros.asm                  - Assembly-language macros used for certain 6309-optimized instructions

main.asm                    - This is the single file used to assemble everything into the final
                              DYNO.BIN program.  It defines the memory layout for all of the
                              various parts of the program and "include"s all of the other assembly
                              files in the engine.  It also contains the startup code and the code
                              for the Main Loop.

math.asm                    - Math helper functions. Currently this file contains functions for
                              doing 16-bit by 8-bit unsigned division, and 16-bit by 16-bit
                              unsigned division.

memory.asm                  - Includes functions for managing memory.  There are 2 main groups of
                              memory management functionality provided by DynoSprite: a Virtual
                              Memory subsystem for managing 8k pages and the Graphics Aperature,
                              and a Heap which is used for the Level data tables (COT, SGT, SDTs,
                              ODTs, and Object state data).

menu.asm                    - Functions for executing the Main Menu, which display the menu options
                              and allow the user to choose their Monitor, Controller, and Sound
                              setup.

object.asm                  - Functions used by the level loading code for initializing and
                              destroying the Current Object Table.

sound.asm                   - Functions for handling audio waveform playback.

system.asm                  - Miscellaneous low-level functions for initializing the Coco hardware,
                              calling the DSKCON routine for disk I/O, setting the graphics mode
                              and palettes, IRQ handling, and debugging (SWI).

utility.asm                 - Miscellaneous functions, currently including: string length
                              calculation, psuedo-random number generation, and binary to ASCII
                              hexadecimal conversion.


Script Files (Python)
---------------------

These scripts are used by the build system (they are called from the Makefile) to process, compile,
and package various game resources for the final disk image.

binsectionmover.py - Some parts of the DYNO.BIN program reside in memory locations which conflict
                     with BASIC, and therefore must be loaded into benign locations by LOADM and
                     then moved to their correct destinations after starting up DynoSprite. The
                     output from the assembler (DYNO.BIN) places these binary sections in their
                     final locations, as is necessary for proper absolute addressing within the
                     code. This script is used to modify the DYNO.BIN program image after
                     assembling to load those binary sections at their initial (benign) locations.

build-images.py    - Processes the input splash images (game/images/*.png) by loading pixel data,
                     converting to packed 4-bit pixels, generating Composite and RGB palettes,
                     compressing the pixel data, packaging into IMAGES.DAT file, and generating
                     gamedir-images.asm Game Data Directory file.

build-levels.py    - Parses the level description files (game/levels/*.txt) and background tilemap
                     files (game/levels/*.map).  Reads the raw binary output from assembling the
                     level assembly code files (game/levels/*.asm) and packages all of this data
                     into the LEVELS.DAT file.  Also generates the gamedir-levels.asm Game Data
                     Directory file.

build-objects.py   - Reads the raw machine code generated by the assembler for the Object handling
                     code (game/objects/*.asm) and the Sprite draw/erase code (which is generated
                     by the Sprite compiler). Packages the Sprite and Object data into OBJECTS.DAT
                     file, and generates the gamedir-objects.asm Game Data Directory file.

build-readme.py    - Parses the game/readme-bas.txt file and generates the README.BAS file for
                     displaying the game's README documentation.

build-sounds.py    - Reads all of the raw audio waveform files (build/obj/sound*.raw) and packages
                     them into SOUNDS.DAT file.  Also generates the gamedir-sounds.asm Game Data
                     Directory file.

build-tiles.py     - Reads all of the tileset definition files (game/tiles/*.txt), packages them
                     into output TILES.DAT file, and generates the gamedir-tiles.asm Game Data
                     Directory file.

compression.py     - Helper functions for compressing and decompressing data streams using the
                     DEFLATE algorithm.  This data compression is used for various data blocks in
                     all of the game data (*.DAT) files in DynoSprite.

sprite2asm.py      - This is the Sprite Compiler, one of the core pieces of DynoSprite technology.
                     This script reads in a sprite definition file (game/sprites/*.spr) and writes
                     optimized 6809 or 6309 assembly language files for drawing and erasing the
                     sprite images.  Note that these output assembly language files are normally
                     deleted automatically by GNU Make due to some obscure rules about partial
                     build products.  To view the assembly code written by the Sprite Compiler, you
                     can look at the list files instead (build/list/sprite-*.lst).

symbol-extract.py  - Helper script which parses an lwasm listing file (*.lst) and generates an
                     assembly code source file which uses the EQU directives to define the memory
                     locations of all public symbols in the input assembly listing.  This script is
                     used to get the symbol locations of all the DynoSprite engine functions after
                     the first assembly pass, so that these functions may be called from the game-
                     specific code (ie, Level Initialize or Update, Object Update or Draw, etc).

===================================================================================================
=------------------------------------------  Main Loop  ------------------------------------------=
===================================================================================================

The high-level workflow of the main loop is also documented in "engine/main.asm".

1. Wait until the Vertical Retrace interrupt fires and swaps the front/back buffers to begin
   displaing the most recently rendered frame on the monitor.
2. Erase all Sprites drawn to offscreen (back) buffer pair.
3. Set background scrolling position for the new output frame, and draw background tiles as
   necessary.
4. Call Draw function on all Active Objects in the Current Object Table.
5. Increment LastRenderedFrame variable, so that the next Vertical Retrace interrupt will know that
   a new frame is ready for display.
6. Read input status from Joystick or Keyboard and update global variables.
7. Call the Level_CalculateBkgrndNewXY function to calculate the scrolling screen position for the
   next video frame to render.
8. Iterate through each object in the Current Object Table:
   - If Object is active, then call the Object's Update function
   - otherwise, call the Object's Reactivate function

===================================================================================================
=----------------------------------------  Architecture  -----------------------------------------=
===================================================================================================

DynoSprite is object-oriented in nature.  As a game author, you only need to write 6 different
types of assembly language functions to express your game logic: 2 types (Initialize and Update)
for each Level, and 4 types (Initialize, Update, Reactivate, and Draw) for each Object.  Anything
which is dynamic during gameplay and needs to run some code can be a type of Object.  Each Object
type which you define can have any number of instances in the running level.  Each instance will
use the same code but have its own unique state data space.  Most Objects will be drawn on the
screen using a single Sprite or multiple Sprites over time, animating a sequence.  But you could
have Objects which are never drawn and only provide some processing function. You can also write
custom Draw functions for your objects.  They could be used to draw multiple Sprites (as with the
6-digit BCD counter object), or do something entirely different.

To illustrate further, you could have an Object which represents a bullet. It could use a fixed
Sprite to draw itself automatically. During its Update function, it could calculate its new
position from its current velocity, check the new position against the screen boundary (to
deactivate itself if it has left the screen), and do collision detection with the main character
Object (to determine if the player should lose a life).  You could have another Object which
represents a certain type of enemy.  It could have many of the same behaviors as the bullet but
have an animated Sprite sequence, and move in a fixed pattern instead of with a fixed velocity. You
could also have an Object for the main character.  During its Update function, it would check the
input joystick state and move itself accordingly.  It could do collision detection to determine if
the player has picked up a key at a special location, or fallen off of the current platform on
which it was standing (putting the main character into a 'falling' mode).

In the DynoSprite engine, Sprites and Objects are linked together in groups. For each group, the
author will write a Sprite description file (game/sprites/XX-GroupName.spr) which contains
parameters and pixel matrices for all Sprites in the group, and an Object code file
(game/objects/XX-GroupName.asm) which contain 4 functions (Initialize, Update, Reactivate, and
Draw) for each Object in the group.  There is no relationship necessary between the number of
Sprites in a group and the number of Objects in the same group.  As a game author, you can
organize your game objects into Sprite/Object Groups any way you desire.  For instance, it might
make sense to have one Group for your main character, one Group for your enemy objects, or one
Group for each different type of enemy, and one Group for numeric displays (ie, score counter).
The Sprite colors are referenced against the palettes which are defined in the Tilesets, so unless
you reserve certain colors to be common across multiple Tilesets, you will probably need to use
different Sprite/Object Groups with each Tileset.  For example, you may have one set of Sprites
and Objects which work with the colors defined in a Tileset for underwater levels, while you use a
different set of Sprites and Objects to go with the colors defined in another Tileset for outer
space levels.

Each Level in a game may use as many Sprite/Object Groups as you want.  The particular Groups to
load with a level are defined in the Level's description file (game/levels/XX-LevelName.txt).  You
are only limited by the amount of available memory.

===================================================================================================
=--------------------------------------  Data Structures  ----------------------------------------=
===================================================================================================

There are several data tables which are important to the object-oriented game model used by
DynoSprite, and may be used during the game-specific assembly code written by the game author.
These tables are documented thoroughly in the datastruct.asm file, and also explained here.
These tables are stored on the heap (doc/AddressMap.txt).  They are initialized when the Level is
loaded from disk, and they stay on the heap for the duration of that level.

The Current Object Table (COT) contains one entry for each Object instance which is currently
present in the Level. Note that it is possible to dynamically create and delete objects during
gameplay, but this behavior is not used by the demo.  The Level description file (game/levels/
XX-Name.txt) contains a parameter which specifies the maximum size of this table, which may be
necessary to support dynamic Object creation.  Note that not all of the Objects in this table have
to be visible or drawn on the screen.  You can organize the object however you want.  For example,
you may use the first object in a level for the main character, the next 5 for enemies, another 4
objects for active bullets, etc.

Each entry in the COT contains index values for the Group Index and Object Index within the
Group, then an Active bit-flag which specifies if the object should be drawn, and if it should
be updated.  It also contains the current global X and Y coordinates (relative to the entire
background tilemap, not relative to the screen start), and a pointer to the state data for the
object.  It also contains pointers to the ODT, SDT, and RowCrop tables for the Group, which are
used as a performance optimization during object handling (this saves expensive table lookups).

The Sprite Group Table (SGT) binds together all of the Sprite/Object groups for the current level.
Each Sprite/Object Group which was loaded into the current level has one entry in this table.
Each table entry contains the Group's index number, the total number of Sprites and total number
of Objects in this Group, and pointers to the SDT and ODT tables for the group.

There is one Sprite Descriptor Table (SDT) loaded for each Sprite/Object Group in the current
level. This table contains one entry for each Sprite in the Group.  Some of the parameters stored
in this table are: the Width and Height of the Sprite, the number of bytes to reserve for storing
the background pixel data for erasing the Sprite, and pointers to functions for drawing and erasing
the Sprite.  All of this data is automatically generated by the build system.

There is also one Object Descriptor Table (ODT) loaded for each Sprite/Object Group in the current
level. This table contains one entry for each Object in the Group. The paramaters stored for each
Object in the table are: number of bytes expected in the object initialization stream (which are
normally taken from the Level Description file) for this type of object, the number of bytes of
Object state data to store for each instance of this type of Object, the drawing type used for
this Object (standard single Sprite draw, or custom draw function), and pointers to the 4 Object
handling functions (Initialize, Reactivate, Update, and Draw).

To see how the various data members in these tables work together, you can examine the source code
in game/objects/02-balls.asm.  This object uses a single byte in the initialization stream (taken
from the InitData list in the [Object] sections in game/levels/01-marbledemo.txt).  The value of
this initialization byte tells the ball object which 'type' of ball it should be.  There are 2
static balls (Whole and Outline), and 4 dynamic balls (clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of
2 different sprite animation sequences).  The Ball Object also defines a data structure (G2OB0)
which contains the state data for each instance of a Ball object in the Current Object Table.  This
data structure contains the Sprite Index (within the current Sprite/Object Group) for drawing the
object at the next time it's drawn, the Ball Type (copied from the initialization stream in the
Object Initialization function), the 8-bit fractional position of the Ball (the integer position is
stored in the Current Object Table), the current velocity of the ball (in 8.8-bit fixed-point
notation), and an 'odometer' counter which is used to determine which Sprite to show in the
animation sequence.  The faster the ball is traveling, the faster it will rotate.  The Object
Initialization function (Demo_Grp2Object0_Init) shows how each Object instance's state data is
initialized when it is created.  In the demo, there are 5 Ball objects created at level load time.
The Update function (Demo_Grp2Object0_Update) contains code for doing collision detection between
different balls, and velocity calculation for a ricochet effect.  At the end of this source file,
the Object Descriptor Table is defined which describes all of the Objects provided by this Group.

===================================================================================================

Creating Sounds
---------------

Sound waveforms for use with DynoSprite should be stored in an uncompressed WAV file.  They will
automatically be converted to the proper bit depth and sampling frequency by ffmpeg during the
build process.  You can select whatever audio output frequency you want for your game by setting
the AudioSamplingRate parameter in engine/globals.asm.  Higher frequencies will sound better but
use more CPU time while audio is playing.  To play a sound when something happens (ie, during the
Level Update or Object Update functions), just call the Sound_Play function with the waveform
number that you want to play in register B.  There is no descriptive file necessary for the audio
waveforms. The build system will process all WAV files that it finds in "game/sounds/" which start
with two digits.  The number given in the filename is the same waveform number that you should
supply to the Sound_Play function.

Creating Sprites
----------------

Currently, the sprites must be defined in the proprietary and self-explanatory SPR files.  In order
to make new sprites, you will need to manually copy the sprite pixel layout into an SPR file, or
integrate DynoSprite into your workflow with a graphic sprite generation tool either by writing a
custom conversion script to generate the SPR files, or modifying the 'sprite2asm.py' script to
read the sprite definition file which is exported natively by your sprite tool.  I will probably do
this later, once I start working on my own game with DynoSprite.

Creating Splash Images
----------------------

The Splash images used for the menus and level loading screens in DynoSprite are generated from
PNG images.  I used the 'grafx2' open-source 'pixel art' program to draw the main menu background.
Using a pixel art program, you can start by loading either the Composite or RGB palette files
(located in tools/palettes/).  Then set your image size (to whatever you want, but no larger than
320x200, and with an even width) and start drawing.  As long as you do not use more than 16 colors
in your image, the scripts/build-images.py script will correctly process the file and provide
palettes for both RGB and Composite monitors.  If you do use more than 16 colors, the build process
will fail with an error.

Creating Tilesets and Level Tilemaps
------------------------------------

Currently, Tilesets are defined in the proprietary and self-explanatory "game/tiles/*.txt" files,
and Tilemaps for each level are defined in the "game/levels/*.map" files.  In order to integrate
DynoSprite with a graphical tilemap generation tool, you will need to either write a custom
conversion script to generate the Tileset and Tilemap files as expected by DynoSprite, or modify
the "build-tiles.py" and "build-levels.py" scripts to work with the native file types which are
exported by your tools.

Creating Objects
----------------

To create Objects which can be displayed using the Sprites in a particular Group, you must write
an assembly language file (game/objects/XX-GroupName.asm) which contains 4 functions for each
Object in the Group: Initialize, Update, Reactivate, and Draw.  This file must also define the
number of Objects in the Group, and the Object Descriptor Table.  These last 2 items must be placed
at the end of the file.  Look at the demo file (game/objects/02-balls.asm) for an example.

Creating Levels
---------------

For each Level in your game, you will need to create 3 files: 1) a Level Description file, which
gives certain Level parameters and starting Object information, 2) a Level Tilemap file which
specifies the background tilemap for the level, and 3) an assembly language file which contains the
source code for 2 Level-specific functions: Level_Initialize and Level_CalculateBkgrndNewXY. Look
at the demo files in game/levels/* for an example.

DynoSprite is flexible in the way that you can handle the Current Object Table during gameplay in
a Level.  The demo is simple: it just creates 5 objects (the Marbles, defined in the Level
Description File), initializes them in the standard way during Level Load, and they exist for the
duration of the Level.  You could also use this methodology for a game: create an object for your
main character and one for each of the enemies in the level, and let them exist for the duration
of the level.  You can use the activation flag to help with this if your levels are large. The
Objects can be deactivated when they are offscreen, and during the Reactivate call they can test
the background screen position to see if they will be onscreen in the next frame.  If so, they can
reactivate themselves, which will cause their Draw/Erase and Update functions to be called during
the next main loop cycle. During the Update function, the Object should test to see if it's going
off-screen, and if so then deactivate itself.  This mechanism should help performance by avoiding
the overhead of unnecessary draw or update function calls.

Another possible way to use the Current Object Table is to create and destroy objects dynamically
while the level is running. This would be useful for a game where you have lots of enemies and
they randomly come in from off-screen. There are currently no helper functions for handling this,
so you must manually modify the data stored in the global variables "Obj_NumCurrent" and the data
tables pointed to by "Obj_CurrentTablePtr" and "Obj_StateDataPtr".  It would be easiest to only
create or destroy elements on the end of the list, and it would also be easiest to only create or
destroy Objects during the Level_CalculateBkgrndNewXY function.  If you add/remove Objects during
one of the Object handling functions, you may break the operation of the Object processing loop in
main.asm.  This code could be modified to support adding/removing Objects during the processing
loop.

Finally, you could also use a combination of the two described Object Table handling mechanisms.
Some Objects could always reside at the same place in the Current Object Table, while others are
dynamically created and destroyed as necessary.

Also, feel free to customize the DynoSprite engine itself as necessary.  The Direct page has some
free space and could be used to store special global variables which could be used by all of the
Level and Object code.
